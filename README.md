# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

Two different datasets consisting of ride-sharing data, that included location, date/fare for each ride, and city data, was analyzed and depcited visually. The project was done in order to provide recommendations to the CEO that provides visual insight comparing fare information for urban, suburban, and rural areas. 

### Results

The datasets were merged and varying libraries were used to manipulate, clean, and visualize the data for the different city types. The following observations were determined as a result of the analysis:

 * There ultimately significantly more rides in urban cities when compared to rural cities (1625 / 125 rides).
 * The average fare per ride and fare per driver is less for ubran cities when compared to rural cities.
 * The total fares is significantly higher in urban cities than in rural cities and slightly more in suburban cities.
